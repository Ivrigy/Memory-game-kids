### Simple memory card game for children

Memorishka game is made for kids but it can also be useful for people of all other ages as a great tool to enhance visual memory and concentration. The game can be played by one or more players (if so then recommended on iPad).The object of the game is to turn over all pairs of matching cards.

## Scope

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the scope of this project focuses on providing a simple, engaging interface that children can easily interact with on both desktop and mobile devices. Focus was on Javascript and in order to enhance my practice I scoped my project too high for knowledge I was able to attain spending extremely hong hours reading (unfortunately long amount of text instead watching a teacher explain!) and practicing assignments. So the first MVP scope that had 3 difficulty levels turned to be too much for me so i went for the AMVP (A as in Absolute.) I focused on elementary features and created following user stories.  

## User Stories

As a child: I want a simple memory game that I can easily understand and do
As a child: I want game to be fun and colorful
As a child: I want a fun and friendly competition to see who can turn more cards

## Features
As a fully minimalistic game with the main focus on the user needs, this project also had basic and minimalistic features.

### Heading

As the AMVP is focused on the game itself the heading of the website is also minimalistic simultaneously aiming to address the Title and bring super minimalistic explanation of how to play the game. As part of my users are still not able to read, but for probably have played  same game in physical form, whole section is modelled to that. 

### Game and Cards

I wanted to create a simple, colorful interface that immediately draws children’s attention to the game container. Each card contains engaging images or patterns that correspond to second user story. Images of animals are graphical what also corresponds with age of the main user. 

### Buttons and actions

This section of the game’s interface displays two different functions that the game offers. The score counter provides immediate feedback by tallying how many attempts a player has made while searching for matching card pairs, encouraging a more strategic approach to each flip. I decided to include only this function, without a timer, as a timer can put too much pressure on kids. The Restart button, prominently displayed, allows for a swift reshuffle and a full game reset, granting players an instant do-over whenever they want to refine their strategy or simply start fresh. This part of the interface is designed with contrasting colors and clear typography, helping children quickly see their progress and easily restart the game if they wish to try again.

### Favicon
